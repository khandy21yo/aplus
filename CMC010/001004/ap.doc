IV. Special notes
 
  A. Vendor Numbers
 
          Vendor numbers are, are constructed just as customer numbers
     by taking the  first letter of each  word in the name, and taking
     additional letters from the  first  word  if necessary until  the
     desired length is reached.  Maximum length is six.
 
  B. The "Pay Date" stored in VENDOR
          The payables system gives you the capability of specifying a
     "pay  date"  for each vendor, or a day of the month on which that
     vendor's invoices should be paid.  You can then pay all  invoices
     for  all vendors with a specified pay date, using the DATE option
     in the check printer program.
 
  C. The "Discount Amount" stored in VENDOR
          This can be either a rate or an amount;  in either  case  it
     is  a default.  For a rate, enter a number followed by a "percent
     sign" ("%").  For an amount,  enter  just  a  number.   For  each
     invoice  you  will be asked for discount.  Entering <RETURN> will
     enter the default  for  that  vendor.   Entering  anything  else,









                    
                                                                Page 2



     either a rate or an amount, will over-ride this default.
 
  D. General Ledger Entries
          A  cash  account  and one or more Accounts Payables accounts
     will be set up for your system.  When you enter each invoice  you
     will  have  to  enter the expense account.  If you have more than
     one payables account, you will be asked to enter it at the  start
     of   the  enter  option.   The  cash  account  entries  are  made
     automatically since there can be only one accounts  payable  cash
     account.
 
  E. Methods of Paying invoices.
          There  are  five  different  meathods  for  paying invoices.
     Methods 1 thru 3 all place the  word  PAY  in  the  check  number
     column;   writing the check changes the "PAY" to the check number
     used.  The methods are as follows:
 
     (1) Individually by invoice.  Use the PAY option to specify which
     invoices you wish to pay.
 
     (2)  By  Vendor.   Use  the PAY option and specify ALL to pay all
     invoices for that vendor.
 
     (3) By Pay Date.  (See note B. above) Use the  DATE  option,  and
     specify which day you are paying for.  (4) By Invoice Date.  When
     you write checks, specify which date to pay for, and all invoices
     entered on that date will be paid.  (The date entered shows up in
     the CHECK number column as 'Dmm.dd' where mm is the month and  dd
     is  the day). Note:  this option requires no initial "PAY" option
     before check printing.
 
     (5) Partially pay an invoice.  Use the PARTIAL option to  specify
     which  invoice  and  how much to pay.  Partial payments and their
     associated invoices show up with  an  "*"  in  the  check  number
     column.
 
     Note:   If  an  item  which  has  already  been set to pay or has
     already been paid is called out to be paid  again,  the  computer
     will  say  "ALREADY SET TO" followed by the current status of the
     check number field, and will ask how it is to be changed.   Enter
     <RETURN> for no change, enter "." to make it blank, or enter your
     desired code, such as check number or "PAY1".
