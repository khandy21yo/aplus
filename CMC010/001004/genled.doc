                              General Information
 

          This documentation describes the General  Ledger  system  of
     programs,  the  central  system  which "ties together" all of the
     other accounting systems.  The link between  General  Ledger  and
     the  other systems is a file called the CHECK DATA file ( or just
     CKDATA ). CKDATA files are divided into months;  whenever working
     with  a CKDATA file you will be asked which month to work in, and
     the computer will open the correct file for that month.

          This provides for division of information by months, and  is
     the  reason for the "MONTH FOR CHECK DATA ENTRIES ? " question in
     the other systems.  It is important that you enter the month  the
     activity  actually  took place in, rather than the current month,
     if they are different.  For example, invoices  entered  the  last
     day  in May should be updated to the May CKDATA file, even if the
     update does not take place until the next day, in June.

          The General Ledger system consists of six  programs,  listed
     and briefly described below:
 
        CKDATA This  program is used to work with the check data file,
               and allows you to examine the entries made and to print
               check registers.
        CKTOTA This  program  also  works  with the CKDATA file.  It,s
               main  function  is  to  provide  quick  totals  of  the
               information in a CKDATA file.
        ADJENT This  program  is  used  to make journal entries to the
               CKDATA file that are not easily entered through any  of
               the other systems.
        CHART  This program maintains your chart of accounts.
        LEDGER This  program  is used to create and print your monthly
               ledger, and to update that information into the account
               history stored in the CHART file.
        FINSTA This  program  is  used  to print financial statements,
               based on the information obtained from CKDATA.

          Each of these programs will be described in  detail  in  the
     following sections.

The Program CKDATA


I. CKDATA
 
 

          This is the main program you will use in working with CKDATA
     files.   It  is  used  to create new CKDATA files, to examine the
     CKDATA files,  and  to  print  a  check  register.   It  has  the
     following options:
 
 
    ENTER Used  to  enter  checks  into the CKDATA file.  This is
          used primarily for hand checks not entered through  the
          Payables system.
   CHANGE Change the information stored for a check.
  EXAMINE Examine checks in the CKDATA file.
  MISSING Lists all missing check numbers in a file.
    PRINT Print a check register.
     SORT Sort the CKDATA file.
      END End the program, and sort the file if necessary.










































                    
The General Ledger System                                       Page 4
The Program CKDATA


 
 
     The following items are stored for each check in a CKDATA file:
 
 
      
     Item                       Meaning
     ------------------------------------------------------------
     CHECK NUMBER          On a true check written through the Payables
                        system, this will be the check number. Since
                        most entries to CKDATA are not actual checks,
                        but other types of journal entries, the check
                        number has no rean meaning. These types of
                        entries are assigneda check number of "1", or
                        some other number less than 10. There are
                        exceptions to this, such as entries for payments
                        received in which the CHECK NUMBER stores the
                        receipt number, preceeded by an "R" to
                        distinguish it from a true check.
      
     ACCOUNT NUMBER        This is the General Ledger account number
                        which this entry is to apply to.
      
     SOURCE CODE           This is a two-character code indicating
                        where this entry came from. For example, all
                        entries made by the Payroll system will have a
                        source code of "PR".
      
     JOB NUMBER    This is the job number which this item is
                        to apply to. Job numbers will be used only if
                        you are using a system with job costing. Otherwise
                        it should always be blank.
      
     DATE                  The date the check was written, or for other
                        types of entries the invoice date, payroll date,
                        etc.
      
     DESCRIPTION           A description of the entry. For checks it
                        be who the check was written to, for receivables
                        entries the customer name, for payroll entries
                        the employee number, etc.
      
      
 

          All of the options should  be  self-  explanatory,  and  you
     should  be  able  to  quickly  learn  to use them all.  The enter
     option is slightly different from the other options, however, and
     should  be  mentioned  here.   Checks are entered in a horizontal
     format, with columns for each item to be entered.  In this manner
     all entry for one check is made on a single line.  To allow this,
     however, it is necesaary for the program to set the terminal such
     that  nothing  you  type  is  printed  until  after  you type the

     <RETURN> key, in contrast to  the  usual  manner  in  which  each
     character is printed as you type it..

The Program CKTOTA


II. CKTOTA
 

          This program is similar to CKDATA, in that it works with the
     CKDATA file.  It has two main functions.  First, it allows you to
     print the CKDATA file in  chronological  order,  rather  than  in
     check  number  order,  as  CKDATA  does.  Second it allows you to
     print totals by General Ledger Account number.  It has only these
     two options, LIST AND TOTAL

          The list option has three different meathods of listing  the
     file.  They are forewards, backwards, and by specific check.  You
     will be asked," LIST WHAT ? ". Typing a "?" will get you  a  list
     of what to type, and what each possible response means.

          You will also be asked for " ACCOUNT # TO PRINT ? ". Enter a
     <RETURN>  to  print  the entire file.  Enter an account number to
     print all entries with that account number.  Etnter a job  number
     to print all entries with that job number.

The program ADJENT


III.ADJENT
 
 

          This program is designed to be used for initial entry of all
     Journal  Entries  which  do  not  relate  well to the basic entry
     systems for payroll,  accounts  receivable,or  accounts  payable.
     The  program  works on a file called ADJEyy.DAT where "yy" is the
     year, eg.  ADJE79.DAT  contains  adjusting  journal  entries  for
     1979.

          Once a Journal Entry  has  been  entered  to  the  file  and
     checked to insure that the description is correct and the balance
     equal to zero, the entry may be updated to the  check  data  file
     for  any  specified  month,  thus getting the adjustment into the
     general ledger.

          Note that Journal Entries remain in  this  file  even  after
     update  to  a  check  data  file  so that a full year's adjusting
     journal entry register may be obtained.   Once  a  given  Journal
     Entry  has  been  updated,  the  month to which it was updated is
     entered into the file, and the Journal Entry is  "locked  in"  to
     prevent any further entries, changes, or deletions involving this
     Journal Entry number.  Hence, be sure Journal Entries are correct
     before updating them in order to avoid writing Journal Entries to
     adjust other Journal Entries.

          The ENTER option automatically assigns Journal Entry numbers
     consecutively  by  default if <RETURN> is entered at the "#".  It
     is recommended that the default  be  used  except  when  entering
     additional records to a Journal Entry already in the file but not
     yet updated.  All fields in the ADJENT file are the  same  as  in
     the  check  data  file  with  the exceptions of the Journal Entry
     number, ADJENT description, and update month fields, which do not
     exist  in  CKDATA.  The CKDATA description field in ADJENT always
     starts with  "JE  #  ??-".  Thus  there  are  normally  about  22
     characters  of  description  space  in  this  field available for
     manipulation.  The ADJENT description field is 58 characters  for
     each  record  in  a Journal Entry.  This field is totally open to
     user manipulation and should be  used  to  describe  the  journal
     entry  in  complete  detail.   This  description is never sent to
     other files.

          On the following page is a table listing each item you  will
     be  asked  for  when  entering  Journal entries, and the possible
     responses for each.  . .

 This program maintains a file containing your chart of accounts, and
account history for each. For each account will be stored the following:
 
 
ACCOUNT NUMBER             The Number of the account.
 
DESCRIPTION                A description of the account. This can be
                        up to 40 characters long.
 
ACCOUNT TYPE               What type of account this is, such as
                        such as assets, liabilities, etc. Following
                        are the standard codes:
 
                                AC      Current Assets
                                AL      Long Term Assets
                                LC      Current Liabilities
                                LL      Long Term Liabilities
                                OE      Owner's Equity
                                OR      Current Profit or Loss
 
                                RE      Revenue From Sales
                                EC      Expense From Sales
                                EE      Other Expenses
 
OVERHEAD ALLOCATION        A percentage overhead allocation.
 
MONTHLY BUDGET            Budgeted amount for the current month.
 
YEARLY BUDGET              Budgeted amount for the year.
 
HISTORY                    A fifteen-month account history, for
                        use in printing financial statements.

          The program has the following options:
 
   A.ENTER - enter new accounts.  You have the option of entering  the
     account history ( for initially entering accounts ), or of having
     it automatically set to zero.
 
   B. CHANGE - Change any of the stored data for an existing  account.
 
   C. DELETE - Delete an account form the file.
 
   D. EXAMINE-  Examine  a  range  of accounts.  You will be asked for
     starting account  number  and  ending  account  number,  and  all
     accounts there between will be printed.
 
   E. Print - Similar to EXAMINE except will print all accounts.
 
   F. HISTORY - Print the account history for each account.

The Program CHART


   G. BUDGET  - Enter or change budget amounts.  Faster than using the
     change option when you have several accounts to change  at  once,
     such  as  at  the  start  of a new month when many of the monthly
     budgets moght change.
 
   H. RESET - Reverse a LEDGER update.  It is the LEDGER program  that
     updates  the account balances in CHART.  Should you find you need
     to reverse an update for some reason, this option will allow  you
     to do it.  You cannot RESET further back than one month, however,
     because in doing so you would loose some of your account history.
 
   I. ZZZ  -  Also  stored in the file is the month number of the last
     month updated, to insure that a month is not  updated  twice  and
     that  months are not updated out of order.  The ZZZ option allows
     you to enter this month number ,and to change  it  if  necessary.
     Note that changing this number can be rather dangerous because it
     can cause an update of the wrong month or destroy the accuracy of
     the  account  history.   Normally  you only need runn this option
     once when  you  set  up  your  file.   The  LEDGER  program  will
     automatically  change it after that, and insure that your updates
     are done correctly.
 
   J. END - End the program.  This option will automatically sort  the
     CHART file if necessary.

The Program LEDGER


V. LEDGER
 

          The LEDGER program performs three main functions.  First  of
     all,  it  makes from the CKDATA file another file that has all of
     the information grouped by account  number.   This  is  necessary
     before  either  of  the  other  options  can be used.  The second
     option is to print the ledger for thie current month basedon  the
     information  in  this  file.  The third function is to update the
     account balances and history in the CHART file for each  account.
     Since  an  update  is only done once for a month, it is important
     that all of a month's activity be in the CKDATA file beofre  this
     update is done.

          Upon running the program the first thing you will  be  asked
     is  if a new ledger file should be created.  Initially you should
     answer YES, enter the month of the  check  data  file,  and  wait
     while  this file is created.  After a file has once been created,
     however, it is not necessary to create it again  until  the  next
     month.  By answering no you will immediately go to the next part,
     the  SELECTION ?  question.   The   LEDGER   program   has   four
     selections,  PRINT,  WORKSHEET, UPDATE, FIND, and END.  The PRINT
     option prints the General Ledger.Note that it needs the wide  (14
     1/2  inch)  paper.   The  WORK  SHEET option prints a similar but
     shorter worksheet for you to use.  The  find  option  will  check
     through  the  LEDGER file for any account numbers that are not in
     the CHART file, and print them.  You should change  them  in  the
     CKDATA file and re-create the LEDGER file if and are found, sinch
     they cannot be updated until they match a valid account.  After a
     FIND  has  been  run that showes no undefined accounts, and AFTER
     the ledger has been printed, the UPDATE should be done, to update
     this  month's activity into the CHART file.  You will not allowed
     to update if there are any undefined accounts, or if you are  not
     updating the next sequential month from the last month updated.

The Program FINSTA


IV. FINSTA
 

          The FINSTA program is used to print financial statements for
     your  company.   Since  financial  statements are specialized and
     vary from company to company, we do not have  a  standard  FINSTA
     program.  You should consult the individual FINSTA documentation,
     if there is one for your  account,  for  a  description  of  your
     financial statement printer.
