                              General Information
 

          All the programs in this system are entered using  the  MENU
     system (see the MENU documentation for details). You should be in
     the PAYABL system, and need only to type the program name at  the
     "PAYABL>" prompt.

          All typed statements must be followed by a RETURN or  ENTER,
     to   send   the   command   to   the  computer.   Throughout  the
     documentation "<RETURN>" means this RETURN or ENTER key.

          Several programs will ask  "SET  PAGE  ?"  when  you  run  a
     printing option.  This is to allow you to turn the paper to a new
     page so that the list, report, ect.  will start at the top  of  a
     page.   You  should  manually turn the paper to the first line on
     the next page, and press <RETURN>. The computer will  then  start
     printing.

          All programs sort their files if  necessary  when  they  are
     ended.   If you type "END" and the computer responds with "Please
     wait.  . ." this is what is happening.Sorts can take from  a  few
     seconds  to  two  or  three minutes, depending on the size of the
     file being sorted.  When the sort is complete, the computer  will
     respond with a message such as "SORT COMPLETE AT 5:06 PM" and you
     will be able to continue on.

          There are several necessary items that are  unique  to  your
     company,  such as name, address, etc.  These items will be stored
     using a program called UNIQUE.   Specific  information  regarding
     what  is  needed  and how to enter it can be found by calling the
     INSTRUCTIONS option in the UNIQUE program.  One item, however, is
     very important and needs explanation here.  The entry of invoices
     will have a column for purchase order number.  If you specify  NO
     PURCHASE ORDER in UNIQUE, this column will be skipped completely.
     If you specify PURCHASE ORDER, you must enter it.   The  computer
     will  then  look  for that PO number in the PO file.  If it finds
     it, you will be allowed to continue the entry as  usual.   If  it
     does not, it will ask you to confirm entering that PO number.  IF
     you type YES, the entry will continue.

          You will be asked to assign a VENDOR NUMBER to each of  your
     vendor.   This  need  not be a number;  letters can also be used.
     We recommend the following system for assigning  vendor  numbers:
     (1)  Take  the  first  letter of each word in the name.  Example:
     "AS" for ACME SHOELACES or "DJM" for DOE, JOHN  M.  (2)  Take  as
     many  additional  characters  from the first word as necessary to
     make a four letter code.  Example:  "ASCM" for ACME Shoelaces  or
     "DJMO"  for DOE, JOhn M. If this system produces duplicate codes,
     merely replace the fourth character with a number (such as "ASCM"
     and  "ASC1"  ).  In this manner numbers can be assigned that will
     sort the file into semi-alphabetical order and will  be  easy  to
     recall  without  having  to  consult a table each time you need a

                    THE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE SYSTEM OF PROGRAMS
 
 


          The Accounts  Payable  system  consists  of  four  programs.

     These four programs are:
 
 
      VENDOR   Used to maintain a list of your vendors.
      PAHOLD   Used to enter invoices.
      PAYREG   Transfer invoices to the holding file, print a register
               of accounts payable, and specify which invoices to pay.
      PINVCK   Used to print checks for the invoices set to pay in the
               PAYREG program.
 
 
 

          Each of these programs will be described in  detail  in  the
     following sections. . .

The program VENDOR


I. VENDOR


          This program is used to enter, change,  and  delete  vendors
     from the vendor file and to print a vendor list.  The vendor file
     also stores a discount amount or  discount  rate.   This  is  the
     amount  of  discount  or  discount  rate in percent to be used in
     computing discount.  This is  a  default-when  entering  invoices
     using  PAHOLD  you  will  be  asked  for  DISCOUNT.   If you type
     <RETURN>, the default amount or percent from the vendor file will
     be  used.   Otherwise  the amount or percentage you enter will be
     used.  This default is useful if, for example, you have a  vendor
     who gives you a standard discount on all purchases.

          On the following page is a list of each of  the  options  in
     the VENDOR program, and a description of each.

The program VENDOR


 
 
       ENTER   Used   to  enter  a  new  vendor.   Questions  are
               self-explanatory.
       CHANGE  Used to change any item of the information  stored
               for a vendor in the file(entered using the 'ENTER'
               option). This is used for correcting mistakes made
               in entry and for making changes if, for example, a
               vendor's address should change.  Each  item  of  a
               vendor's  data  will be printed one at a time, and
               the computer will wait for a  response  for  each.
               Enter the correct data at this point;  if the item
               is not to be changed, type  <RETURN>,  which  will
               leave the data un-altered.
       DELETE  Used to remove an existing vendor from the file.
       PRINT   This  option  is  used  to  print  a  list  of all
               vendors.  It has two printing forms, and you  will
               be asked which form to use.  The short form prints
               only vendor numbers and names, while the long form
               also prints the vendor's address.
       EXAMINE This  option  is  identical  to  PRINT (long form)
               except it allows you to print a  range  of  vendor
               numbers, rather than the whole file.
       FIND    Identical   to   EXAMINE  except  does  individual
               vendors one at a time.
       SORT    Used to sort the vendor file.  When a  new  vendor
               is  entered using the ENTER option, he remains out
               of order until the file is sorted NOTE:  A sort is
               automatically  done when the program is ended (the
               END option) if it is necessary.
       END     Used to end the program.  Will sort  the  file  if
               necessary.
 

          All three of the other programs  use  the  vendor  file  for
     retrieving information.  No invoices can be entered or statements
     printed for a vendor until he is entered in the vendor file.

The Program PAHOLD


II. PAHOLD


          The payables system works with two files, called the HOLDING
     file  and  the  PAYABLES  file.   Invoices  are  entered into the
     holding file, where they are checked for accuracy  and  corrected
     as  necessary.   They  are then 'updated' into the payables file.
     The reason for this is that when invoices are entered, they  must
     also be entered into a file called the CHECK DATA file for use by
     the general ledger system.  Since this is an irreversable step, a
     holding file is used to allow you to correct any mistakes made in
     entry without affecting the general ledger system.  This entry to
     check   data   is   made   automatically   during   the   update;
     consequentially no changes are  allowed  after  an  update.   The
     procedure,  then, is as follows:  Entries are made to the holding
     file, and a list is obtained  of  these  entries.   The  list  is
     checked for mistakes and any changes are made.  These entries are
     then 'updated' into the payables file using the  PAYREG  program.
     The  rest of the system then works with this payables file.  Each
     option of the  PAHOLD  program  is  explained  in  the  following
     sections:

     the position of the print head at each point in the entry ).
     In order to allow this type of horizontal entry, "NO ECHO" is set,
     which means that nothing you type will be printed at your terminal
     until after you type <RETURN>, in contrast to the usual way in which
     each character is printed as you type it.

     NOTES:
 
 (1) The position at the start.
 (2) I enter ASCC and <RETURN.  The computer prints this and the  name
     for  the  vendor  I  have  entered.   It then goes to a new line,
     prints the vendor number again, and waits for the invoice number.
 (3) I enter "1230000", the invoice number, and <RETURN>.
 ($) I  enter  "1000",  the  Purchase  order number, adn <RETURN>, The
     computer prints this and continues, indicating that it  did  find
     this purchase order in the PO file.
 (5) I  enter  "12547"  adn <RETURN>. Notice that the decimal point is
     not entered, it will be  positioned  automatically.   If  you  do
     enter it, however, the amount will be taken as you enter it.  You
     should, however, enter it without a decimal  ,  because  in  some
     other   programs  entering  it  with  a  decimal  does  not  work
     correctly.
 (6) I type <RETURN> and get 0%, the amount which I previously entered
     in VENDOR as the discount rate.
 (7) I  type <RETURN> again, to enter the default tax code of "E". The
     general ledger number and the job number are taken  from  the  PO
     file  and  automatically  entered.   You will need to enter them,
     however , if you are not using  a  PO  file,  or  if  as  in  the
     following entry you enter a PO number that is not in the PO file.
     After printing these two items, the computer is ready for another
     input.
 (*) I type <RETURN>, and the vendor number ASCC is repeated.
 (9) I enter "1230001" and <RETURN>, to enter this invoice number.
(10) I  enter  "1234" and <RETURN> for the PO number.  This time it is
     not found in the PO file, so the computer asks "ENTER  ANYWAY ?".
(11) I  enter  "YES"  adn  <RETURN>, the computer re-prints the vendor
     number, invoice number ,and PO number,  and  continues  with  the
     entry.
(!2) I enter "10075" and <RETURN>.
(13) I  enter  "3%"  and  <RETURN>,  so  that  a  3%  discount will be
     calculated on this invoice.

(14) I enter "T" and <RETURN>, to show that tax has been calculated on
     this invoice.
(15) This  time  the computer waits for me to enter the general ledger
     number.  I enter"125.01" and <RETURN>.
(16) I enter "jn125" adn <RETURN>, the job number.  This entry is  now
     complete, and I return to the ">" prompt.

The Program PAHOLD


     C.  The CHANGE option

     This option is used to change entries in the holding file.  It is
     largely self-explanatory.  You will be asked  for  vendor  number
     and  invoice  number.   The computer will print the item if it is
     found.  It will then ask "CONFIRM (Y,N,+,-) ?". If aa vendor  has
     more  than  one entry of the same invoice number ( a payment will
     have the same invoice number as the invoice it applies  to  under
     an  open  item  system  )  the change option will always find the
     first one.  The purpose of the confirm question is to  allow  you
     to change these other records.  Typing "+" will cause the compter
     to find the next item with the same invoice number, if it exists.
     A  "-" will "back up" one entry.  In this manner you can find the
     record you wish to change.  When you have the correct one, typing
     a "Y" will allow you to proceed to the actual change.  A "N" will
     return to "vendor # TO CHANGE ? ",  should  you  wish  to  return
     without  changing  anything.Below is a small exapmle of a change.
     What I type is in darker printing.

     D.  The DELETE option

 

          This option is used to delete entries from the holding file.
     It  is  largely  self-explanatory.   It uses the CONFIRM question
     explained under the CHANGE option to find the correct  record  to
     delete.  You should read that section for explanation.
 
 
     F.  The LIST option


          This option prints a list of all items in the holding  file.
     Questions  are  self-explanatory.  If there are no records in the
     holding file,the computer will return to "OPTION ? " when LIST is
     typed.

The PAYREG program


III. The PAYREG Program
 

          This program works with the payables file.  It  is  used  to
     update invoices from the holding file into the payables file, and
     to print a register of all  accounts  payable.   Options  are  as
     follows
 
 
     A.  The REGISTER option

          Identical to LIST except this  option  prints  the  payables
     file instead of the holding file.
 
 
     B.  The EXAMINE option

          This option will list all of the entries for a given  vendor
     in the payables file.
 
 
     C.  The UPDATE option

          This option transfers all records in the holding file to the
     payables file.  The holding file is always empty after an update.
     An update is final and irreversable.  The only way to correct  an
     error  after  an  update  is to enter an adjustment and update it
     into the payables file.  For this reason all  records  should  be
     checked  for  errors  before  an update.  It is during the update
     option that entries are made to the general ledger system.  These
     entries  are  automatic.   You will, however, be asked to enter a
     month to make the entries for, since the  general  ledger  system
     stores  things  by  month.   Consult  the  general  ledger system
     instructions for more information.
 
 
     D.  The END option

          This option will end the  program  and  sort  the  files  if
     necessary.

The PINVCK Program


IV. PINVCK

          This program is used for printing invoice checks.   The  way
     our system pays invoices is as follows:

          (1) All invoices that you wish to pay are  marked  as  such,
     using several different meathods which will be described below.

          (2) Checks are printed for all invoices marked to pay.

          (3) All paid invoices are then  removed  from  the  payables
     register.

          There are several different  ways  to  mark  invoices.   The
     first and easiest is individually, using the PAY option.  Specify
     the vendor number and the specific  invoices  you  wish  to  pay.
     These will show in the register printout with the word PAY beside
     them in the check number column.

          The second way is to pay all invoices for  a  given  vendor.
     Use the PAY option, and enter ALL when asked for which invoice to
     pay.

          A third way is to pay by pay date.  In the vendor file is an
     item  called  PAY  DATE.  This is a day of the month on which may
     wish to pay that vendor's invoices.   Use  the  DATE  option  and
     specify  a  date,  and  all  invoices will be set to pay for each
     vendor who has that pay date.

          A fourth way is to pay by date entered.  When  each  invoice
     is  entered,  the date will be stored and will print in the check
     number column, preceeded by a "D" (as in "D05.17" for an  invoice
     entered  May  17 ).  WHEN YOU PRINT THE CHECKS, you can specify a
     date, and it will set to pay and pay all invoices entered on that
     date.

          The fifth way is to partially pay an invoice ( and this gets
     complicated,  I  must  admit).  Use the PARTIAL option to specify
     which invoice and how much to pay.  In the register, the  invoice
     will  then  show  up  with  an asterisk ("*") in the check number
     column, and there will  be  on  a  separate  line  another  entry
     showing the amount of the partial payment.  As additional partial
     payments are made, more entries will be made until the invoice is
     paid off.  It will then get removed.

          And if you don't like any of these, you can always write the
     check  by  hand and enter it using the VOID option.  It will then
     get transferred to CKDATA without you having to actually write  a
     check using PINVCK.

          If a vendor has more invoices than will fit on one check, it
     will  print  "LISTING  ON SEPARATE SHEET", and you should run the
     ATTACHMENTS options to get a list to attach to the check.
