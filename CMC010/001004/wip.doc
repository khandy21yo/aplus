I. The Various Files

          (1) The JOB file - stores basic information about each  job.

          (2) The WIPACC file - Divides the general  ledger  for  each
     work in process account by job.

          (3) The HOUR file - Divides labor by account and job.

          (4) The EST file - stores job estimates.
 
II. Programs
 
     JOB                       WIPREP
     STASET                    WIPACC
     STATUS                    HOUR
 
III. Normal Sequence
 
     (1) Run JOB and enter the JOB information.
     (2) Run STASET to update current costs.
         (See note below)
     (3) Run STATUS to print daily status reports.
     (4) At the end of the month, run WIPREP for monthly
         work in process report.
     (5) Update WIPACC for the month using the WIPREP program.
         (Sets current costs into "to-date" costs)
 
     Note:   STASET  will  automatically  add new jobs and accounts to
     WIPACC and HOUR as it encounters  them,  but  budget  information
     must be manually entered into WIPACC.
 
IV. Running Information

          Job numbers should be three characters if you are using  job
     phases and five if you are not.  In all systems, the form will be
     either JJJJJ for job number, or JJJ-PP for job number and  phase.
     The distinguishing character is the "-", which should be used for
     no other purpose within a job number code.
 

          The WIPREP is run monthly, similarly to the LEDGER  program,
     to  get  a  monthly  work  in  process report by job and account.
     Note:  Always run STASET for the desired month immediately  prior
     to running WIPREP.

          The STASET program can be run repeatedly  during  the  month
     and  is  used to update current costs from CKDATA.  Costs are not
     updated more than once.


          The STATUS program gives current status reports by  job  and
     will usually immediately follow the STASET program.









                    
                                                                Page 2



          The WIPACC program allows you to enter budget figures by job
     number and general ledger number.

          A "." in the  "UPDATE"  column  in  CKTOTA  indicates  which
     records  have  been  updated  and  which  have  not.  STASET also
     updates to PO file (part of the payables  system)  with  invoices
     for each PO.
