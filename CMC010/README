Version 1.* of the CMC Aplus accounting system.

Originally started with some Digital code for the database (DMS-500?),
which was probably a precursor to RMS written in Basic+.
After loading that code into the program, it left only 3 or 4K for
the rest of the rogram, So a simpler database was created that was much
smaller, called isam. tis version was much smaller, but retained the
nmes abs parameters used by the original library.

each user had his own custimized versions of the programs, stored
in his own account. not much of this code survives.

a menu system was eventully created, called 'do'.

dates were not stored in a Y2K complient format.
The data files were limited to 32K records.
Designed to be used on lA35 terminals, as both a printer and a scope
were too expensive for most users $2K each)
data files were sorted after leaving Uthe programs, not immediately.

these files were transfered from a PDP-11 in binary mode, and where
it made sense they were converted to nix line format to make them
readable.
