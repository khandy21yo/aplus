This version ws an upgrade to the CMC010 version.

the programs were designed for vt100 terminals, with hardcoded escape
sequences. iSaM was still in use.

The menuing system was updted to "menu' with more features.

was offered commercially, but mostly used by timesharing customers
because of the cost of the necessary hardware. Some users had their
own systems.

isam was rewritten to be faster 9delayed updating the headers of the
files until they were closed to avoid thrashing when records were being
added0=, etc.).

Much of the code exists, but much of it has been through a decompiler.
storage was expensive, and it was easier to decompile it than recover
the soure from tapes.
