Based on the CMC020 code, but completely rewritten.

uses RMs data files, dates are stored as 'YYYYMMDD' so is Y2K complient.
uses SMG so multiple terminal tyoes work, but VT220;s with their extra
function keys are preferred.

menu rewritten to handle multiple menu levels. menus were stored as text
files. 

Most of the code is here. Should be easy to recompile. a build script
is included. Make sure you create the .olb files with room for many more
symbols and objects than it defaults to.

there are some scripts that need to be run before using, they define the
location of the source and compiled code. Modify for your system.
