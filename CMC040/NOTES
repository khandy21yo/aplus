NOTES for problems I may need later.

To move the physical cursor to the correct window, call top_pabel();

To resize the screen, see resizeterm(). I don't know it it works ons
a real terminal.

Ro compile in clang

	export CXXFLAGS='-std=c++11 -O0 -g'
	export CXX=clang++
	export CC=clang

Problems with BGosub

	1. Confuses the debugger. Loses track of line being exevuted.
	2. Confuses GCC's optimizer. Variables optimized out that shoulfn't be.

Curses will leave a xterm in a weird state if the program crashes.
Scrollback doesn't work, and may not cr/lf at end of lines. Rerun program
and exit to reset.

When converting an array to a vector, .resize() it to skip over the
invalid access bugs.
