This is a test, trying to convert the CMC030 code from Basic to C++.

The code here is barely tested, and probably not very functional, and will
change radically at any time. Much of the code will be disabled while other
parts are being worked on.

Much of the code has been translated using btran
(http://github.com/khandy21yo/btran.git), and requires the libraryies ands
 headers that it supplies.

Necessary packages required to compile include

	btran
	libboost-dev
	postgresql
	libpq-dev
	pkg-config		Required for ncurses to configure
	libncurses-dev
	autoconf
	autoconf-archive

Some of the changes from the VMS version

	Change struct's to classes

	Change character arrays to std::string

	Change array of strings (char *x[])  passed to vector of strings
	(std::vector<std::string> &x).

INSTALLATION

	Modify Makefile.am so itknowd where btran is installed.

	Execute "./makeall" to build executables.

	Ctraye PostgreSQL database for current user "createdb".

	Execute "tk_spec_inslib" to build help messages. Answer the three
	questions with "*", "P", and "*". It will grind for sometime.

	Start the application. "ut_spec_amortization" is currenty the only
	one that works. amd does anything useful.
