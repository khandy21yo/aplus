This is a test, trying to convert the CMC030 code from Basic to C++.

The code here is barely tested, and probably not very functional, and will
change radically at any time. Much of the code will be disabled while other
parts are being worked on.

mate-terminal does not work well with this software. The software makes
extensive use of BOLD, and mate-terminal displays BOLD as normal characters.
Navagating the menus without BOLD is extremely difficult. xterm and
gnome-terminal work much better.

Much of the code has been translated using btran
(http://github.com/khandy21yo/btran.git), and requires the libraryies ands
 headers that it supplies.

Necessary packages required to compile include

	btran
	libboost-dev
	postgresql
	libpq-dev
	pkg-config		Required for ncurses to configure
	libncurses-dev
	autoconf
	autoconf-archive

Some of the changes from the VMS version

	Change struct's to classes

	Change character arrays to std::string

	Change array of strings (char *x[])  passed to vector of strings
	(std::vector<std::string> &x).

	Uses a database tables in place of text libraries.

INSTALLATION

	You will probably want to dedicate a user account to this program,
	as it uses the acount name for the database name, and stores work
	files on the acount.

	Modify Makefile.am so itknowd where btran is installed.

	Execute "./makeall" to build executables.

	Execute 'makeworld' script to initialize databases with some
	default values.

	Start the application. "ut_spec_amortization" is currenty the only
	one that works. amd does anything useful.
