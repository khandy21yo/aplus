This is a test, trying to convert the CMC030 code from Basic to C++.

The code here is barely tested, and probably not very functional, and will
change radically at any time. Much of the code will be disabled while other
parts are being worked on.

Much of the code has been translated using btran
(http://github.com/khandy21yo/btran.git), and requires the libraryies and headers
that it supplies. An example translation command is

~/btran/src/btran ../../CMC030/tk/source/tk_spec_checkline.bas  > tk_spec_checkline.cc

Necessary packages required to compile include

	btran
	libboost-dev
	postgresql
	libpq-dev
