This subrirectory contains implementation of several VMS functions
that are not standard under normal POSIX enviornment.

This includes LIB$, SMG$, etc..

These functions are implemented only as far as necessary to provide
the functionality to the aplus CMC040 code. The parameter passing
mechanisms and types are not impleented accurately, just close enough
to work with the translated code.
