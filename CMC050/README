system.

Drops any attempt at being compatable with the VMS version

C++

	Not even attempting anything like Java. It's too dependent on
	version numbers.

PostgreSQL

	Has no concept of Prevois/Next record. Only sets of data.

UI
	Graphical instead of textual

Printouts

	PDF only

Help

	No integrated help text. Nobody used it anyway.

WHere possiblt, programs that are "scriptable" will be used
instead of individual programs for data entry and reporting.
